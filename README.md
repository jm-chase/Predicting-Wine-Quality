# Predicting-Wine-Quality
Supervised Learning project determining the most important physiochemcial properties of a poor, good, or great wine.

# Techniques
Several different classification algorithms were evaluated including a gradient boosting classifier, logistic regression classifier, and a
random forest classifier.  The random forest classifier was the most accurate algorithm, and was more accurate with the full imbalanced data.

# Summary
The most important properties in predicting a wine's quality are alcohol, volatile acidity, and sulphates.  Wine quality can be predicted 
with 97% accuracy knowing just these three attributes.
